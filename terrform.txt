1. what is terraform and introduction 

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as Code tool developed by HashiCorp. 
It is used to define and provision the complete infrastructure using an easy-to-learn declarative language. 
It is an infrastructure provisioning tool where you can store your cloud infrastructure setup as codes.

2.infrastructure as code IAAS

Infrastructure as a Service Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service model in which computing resources are hosted in a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud.

IaaS model, a business—which can be of any size—consumes services like compute, storage, and databases from a cloud provider. The cloud provider offers those services by hosting hardware and software in the cloud.


3.IAAs on cloud AWs,Azure 


There are a few key reasons developers choose to use Terraform over other Infrastructure as Code tools: Open source: Terraform is backed by large communities of contributors who build plugins to the platform.
 Regardless of which cloud provider you use, it’s easy to find plugins, extensions, and professional support.

IaaS or Infrastructure as a service is one of Amazon Web Services that focuses on providing infrastructure services based on cloud computing technology. 
It’s not difficult to name an organization that provides IaaS but among the top providers worldwide, AWS stands out as the front runner for IaaS cloud services.

In a nutshell, enterprises that are already working with MS products are naturally positioned to pick Azure to cater to their IaaS & PaaS requirements. 
Microsoft is more welcoming of open source technologies; as a matter of fact, aver 50% of its workloads run on Linux OS

$ terraform version


5 Terraform DSL-HCL

HCL isn’t a DSL for Terraform. 
It is a DSL for declarative configuration. 
YAML is also a DSL for declarative configuration. 
The assertion that they are somehow different is odd to me. 
The HCL you write in Terraform doesn’t just port over to other HCL projects like Vault, Consul, or Nomad. If you don’t want to learn HCL, that is fine, but it is literally just a better JSON for configuration. 
It has a very similar shape to JSON, but without the headaches.
